# GitHub Release Text Generator

This repo is for a CLI tool to create text for a release on GitHub.

> **_"Doesn't GitHub have that built into the release page?"_**

Yup! It's very handy, but... I found it lacking for my own use. I like to separate pull requests in the output into their own section based on what the pull request was doing.

For example, this is what the native _"generate release notes"_ tool on GitHub does:

This is a sample of what this CLI tool generates:

## üèóÔ∏è Building from source

### üß∞ Pre-requisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
    - You will also need to install the pre-requisites for your platform [located here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net7%2Cwindows#prerequisites).
        - For Linux based platforms, you primarily need to ensure that packages for `clang` and `zlib` (dev) packages are installed to your system.

### üß± Building

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**
> 
> Before building, you need to know the ["runtime identifier"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog#known-rids) for your platform. For simplicity, these docs will use `linux-x64`. Replace that value with what you use, if needed.
> 
> For example if:
> * You're building on a **x64 Linux-based system**, the identifier would be `linux-x64`.
> * You're building on an **Apple-silicon macOS system**, the identifier would be `osx-arm64`.

#### Command-line

1. Set your current directory to where you cloned the repo.
2. Run the following command:

```plain
dotnet publish ./src/ConsoleApp/ --configuration "Release" --output "./build/ConsoleApp" --runtime "linux-x64" --self-contained
```

The compiled binary will be located in the `./build/ConsoleApp` directory in the local repo.

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Open the command palette (`Shift+Ctrl+P` **(Windows/Linux)** / `Shift+Cmd+P` **(macOS)**).
2. Type in **Tasks: Run Task** and press `Enter`.
   * **Ensure that is the selected option before pressing `Enter`.**
3. Select **Publish: ConsoleApp**.
4. Select your platform's runtime identifier.

The compiled binary will be located in the `./build/ConsoleApp` directory in the local repo.

## üèÉ Using the CLI tool

### üß∞ Pre-requisites for running

- [git](https://git-scm.com)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
    - Ensure you're [logged into your GitHub account with the `gh` CLI tool](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login).
